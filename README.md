# INF2214 Assignment 1 – Campus Cafe Event Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a **Kafka-based streaming pipeline** for a campus cafe. Each customer interaction (order, loyalty card scan, etc.) is emitted as a JSON event. The pipeline consists of a **producer** that sends events to a Kafka topic and a **consumer** that reads and prints them.
